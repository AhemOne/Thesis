##    1.1 Chassis

  The Chassis is designed to support all parts 

##    1.2 Steering and Suspension
###   1.2.1 Steering
####  1.2.1.1 Actuation system

The functional requirements of steering actuation:
- withstanding the forces applied without changing the positioning
- have enough force to push against the the aforementioned forces to change positioning when required
- light enough not to impose a large weight penalty to the vehicle
- small enough not to intrude into the air space around the vehicle
- large changes at low speed to minimise turning radius at low speeds
- small changes at high speed to maximise stability and positional accuracy

####  1.2.1.2 Linkages

The functional requirements of the linkages are:
- light enough as to not impose a weight penalty to the vehicle
- strong enough to withstand the applied forces
- any exposed parts must be as aerodynamic as possible to minimise drag losses

####  1.2.1.3 Damping

The functional requirements of the steering damping are:
- must reduce the impact upon the linkages/actuators such that they are not damaged by bumps
- must not impede the steering actuators from changing position quickly

####  1.2.2.1 Spring
####  1.2.2.2 Damper
####  1.2.2.3 Linkages
###   1.2.3 Rear Suspension
####  1.2.3.1 Spring
####  1.2.3.2 Damper
####  1.2.3.3 Linkages
