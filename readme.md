#     1. Thesis

The current state of the art:
- [Current record holder](http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/fastest-battery-powered-remote-controlled-model-car-(rc))
- [Internals](https://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/18/remotely-hobbyist-takes-control-of-a-tiny-200-m-p-h-super-car/)
- [Small info. nuggets](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?2038871-New-Guinness-World-Record%C2%97FASTEST-BATTERY-POWERED-RC-CAR)
- [nuggets 2](http://www.redrc.net/2009/10/guinness-certifies-nic-caseâ€™s-speed-record/)

This can be summarised as:
- Record speed: 325 km/h
- streamlined body, based off [Team Associated] TC3 chassis (now discontinuted)
  - body was lengthened
  - TC => Touring Car


##    1.1 Chassis

  The Chassis is designed to support all parts 

##    1.2 Steering and Suspension
###   1.2.1 Steering
####  1.2.1.1 Actuation system

The functional requirements of steering actuation:
- withstanding the forces applied without changing the positioning
- have enough force to push against the the aforementioned forces to change positioning when required
- light enough not to impose a large weight penalty to the vehicle
- small enough not to intrude into the air space around the vehicle
- large changes at low speed to minimise turning radius at low speeds
- small changes at high speed to maximise stability and positional accuracy

####  1.2.1.2 Linkages

The functional requirements of the linkages are:
- light enough as to not impose a weight penalty to the vehicle
- strong enough to withstand the applied forces
- any exposed parts must be as aerodynamic as possible to minimise drag losses

####  1.2.1.3 Damping

The functional requirements of the steering damping are:
- must reduce the impact upon the linkages/actuators such that they are not damaged by bumps
- must not impede the steering actuators from changing position quickly
